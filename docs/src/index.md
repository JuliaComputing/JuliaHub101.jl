Documentation is an important aspect of writing software.
Good documentation can:

- explain what the software accomplishes
- help new users trouble shoot problems
- onboard new teammates more effectively
- provide useful tutorials and tips

## How to Document

This documentation (like virtually all other Julia packages) was made with
`Documenter.jl` + `DocumenterTools.jl`. These two packages help to deliver first
class documentation fast and easy.
