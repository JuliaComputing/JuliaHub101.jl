# Math

## Simple

The `JuilaHub101` package defined some functions to perform simple math, like
squaring and cubing numbers.

Let's see what we know about the `square` function.

```@docs
square(x)
```

Now let's see what we know can find out about the `cube` function.

```@docs
cube(x)
```

## Intermediate

`JuliaHub101` also defined a custom implementation of `gcd`.
It's documented here.

```@docs
mygcd
```
